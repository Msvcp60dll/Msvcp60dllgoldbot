# Railway Proxy Wrapper Implementation - PATCH SUMMARY

## Problem Solved
The wrapper was only serving health endpoints, causing webhook and other API requests to fail with 404. The main app was running on PORT+1 but wasn't reachable from the public URL.

## Solution Implemented
Implemented a full proxy in `start_wrapper.py` using aiohttp that:
1. Binds to `0.0.0.0:$PORT` (Railway's assigned port)
2. Serves health endpoints (`/health`, `/healthz`) unconditionally with 200 status
3. Forwards ALL other requests to the backend app running on `PORT+1`
4. Preserves request method, path, query, headers, and body
5. Returns backend responses with proper status codes

## Files Changed

### `/Users/antongladkov/Msvcp60dllgoldbot/start_wrapper.py`

**Key changes:**
```python
# Health paths that always return 200
HEALTH_PATHS = {"/health", "/healthz"}

class ProxyWrapper:
    def __init__(self, port: int):
        self.port = port
        self.backend_port = port + 1  # Backend runs on PORT+1
        self.backend_base = f"http://127.0.0.1:{self.backend_port}"
        
    async def handle_request(self, request: web.Request):
        # Health checks - always return 200
        if request.path in HEALTH_PATHS:
            return web.json_response({
                "status": "ok",
                "source": "wrapper",
                "service": "telegram-stars-membership",
                "version": "1.3"
            })
        
        # Proxy all other requests to backend
        backend_url = self.backend_base + str(request.rel_url)
        # Forward with preserved headers, body, method
        # Return backend response with same status
```

**Features:**
- Catch-all route handler for ALL methods and paths
- Preserves important headers (Content-Type, X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token, etc.)
- Skips hop-by-hop headers (Host, Connection, etc.)
- Configurable timeouts (10s connect, 30s total)
- Returns 502 on backend failure
- Logs requests without exposing secrets or bodies

### `/Users/antongladkov/Msvcp60dllgoldbot/main.py` 
No changes needed - already configured to use PORT+1 when `WRAPPER_HEALTH_ACTIVE=true`

## Verification Results

✅ **Health endpoints (always 200):**
```bash
curl -i https://msvcp60dllgoldbot-production.up.railway.app/health
# HTTP/2 200
# {"status": "ok", "source": "wrapper", ...}

curl -i https://msvcp60dllgoldbot-production.up.railway.app/healthz  
# HTTP/2 200
# {"status": "ok", "source": "wrapper", ...}
```

✅ **Webhook forwarding:**
```bash
curl -i -X POST https://msvcp60dllgoldbot-production.up.railway.app/webhook/$WEBHOOK_SECRET \
  -H "X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token: $WEBHOOK_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
# HTTP/2 200 (request reached backend successfully)
```

✅ **Telegram webhook status:**
```bash
# getWebhookInfo shows:
# URL: https://msvcp60dllgoldbot-production.up.railway.app/webhook/...
# Pending updates: 0
# No errors
```

✅ **Other routes work:**
```bash
curl https://msvcp60dllgoldbot-production.up.railway.app/
# {"name":"Telegram Stars Membership Bot","version":"1.3","status":"running"}
```

## Architecture

```
Internet → Railway (PORT 8080) → Wrapper (proxy)
                                    ├── /health, /healthz → 200 (always)
                                    └── /* → Backend (PORT 8081)
                                              ├── /webhook/*
                                              ├── /admin/*
                                              └── /api/*
```

## To Revert

```bash
# Restore from git
git checkout start_wrapper.py

# Redeploy
railway up --detach
```

## Security & Performance

- ✅ No secrets logged
- ✅ Headers properly forwarded (including X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token)
- ✅ Timeouts configured (10s connect, 30s total)
- ✅ Health checks never blocked by backend issues
- ✅ Backend process managed with proper cleanup
- ✅ Graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM

## Next Steps

1. Monitor logs for any timeout issues
2. Consider adding retry logic for transient backend failures
3. Add metrics for proxy performance
4. Consider rate limiting at proxy level if needed

## Summary

The proxy wrapper implementation successfully resolves the issue where webhook and API requests were failing. All requests now properly reach the backend application while maintaining unconditional health endpoints for Railway's health checks.
